Problem 2: Weather-Based Discounts

Problem:
You want to attract more customers. If it’s hot (temperature is 30°C or more), offer a 20% discount.

Task:
Write a program that:
Ask for the temperature.

Sets the price to:
$0.80 if temperature >= 30
$1.00 otherwise
Outputs the final price.

Sample Input:
Enter today's temperature in Celsius: 32

Sample Output:

It's hot! Lemonade costs $0.80 today.

//Code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    int temperature;
    
    cout<< "Enter today's temperature in Celsius: ";
    cin>> temperature;
    
    if(temperature >= 30) {
        cout<< "It's hot! Lemonade costs $0.80 today.";
    }
    
    else {
        cout<< "The Lemonade costs $1.00.";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
